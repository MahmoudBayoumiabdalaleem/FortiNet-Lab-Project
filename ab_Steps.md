# Lab Steps

## Objective of the Lab
The purpose of this lab is to configure a secure network environment using Fortinet devices to:
1. Provide complete network protection using FortiGate Firewalls (Local and Remote).
2. Analyze network data using FortiAnalyzer.
3. Manage network settings via FortiManager.
4. Authenticate users and secure access through FortiAuthenticator.
5. Test connectivity between local and remote clients while ensuring secure internet access.

## Topology
The network includes:
1. Local and Remote clients.
2. Local and Remote FortiGate Firewalls.
3. Linux server connected to multiple subnets.
4. Management tools like FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, and FortiAuthenticator.

## Steps of the Lab
### Step 1: Initial Setup
1. Connect devices as per the topology.
2. Assign appropriate IP addresses to interfaces.

### Step 2: Configure Local-FortiGate
1. Set up interfaces and firewall policies for internet and internal communication.

### Step 3: Configure Remote-FortiGate
1. Set up interfaces and optional VPN settings for secure communication.

### Step 4: Configure FortiAnalyzer
1. Enable logging and register devices.

### Step 5: Configure FortiManager
1. Add FortiGate devices and configure centralized policies.

### Step 6: Configure FortiAuthenticator
1. Set up user authentication via RADIUS or LDAP.

### Step 7: Testing the Lab
1. Test connectivity, firewall policies, and logging.

## Results
- Successful connectivity between local and remote devices.
- Secure logging on FortiAnalyzer.
- Centralized policy management via FortiManager.
